# Speech-to-Text Project Status

## Current Status: Alpha Stage

The project is currently in an early functional state with several limitations and areas for improvement.

### What's Working
- Enhanced speech transcription with improved accuracy for English language
- Real-time audio processing from microphone input with advanced filtering
- Automatic typing of transcribed text
- Support for multiple Whisper model sizes
- Basic UI with expanded configuration options for audio quality
- Automatic microphone calibration 
- Voice activity detection and noise filtering

### Recent Updates
- **English-Optimized Processing**: Focused the application exclusively on English transcription for improved accuracy.
- **Anti-Hallucination System**: Implemented specialized prompt engineering and post-processing to address common hallucination patterns like "Thank you" repetitions.
- **Advanced Audio Processing**: Added pre-emphasis filtering, dynamic energy thresholding, and noise reduction capabilities to enhance input quality.
- **Microphone Calibration**: Added automatic background noise measurement and microphone sensitivity adjustment.
- **Voice Activity Detection**: Implemented smarter detection of speech versus background noise with variation analysis.
- **Contextual Transcription**: Added system to maintain context between phrases for more coherent transcription.
- **Dark Mode UI**: Implemented a new dark mode UI with both maximized and minimized views. This new interface offers improved visual aesthetics but has not yet been functionally integrated with the core speech recognition engine.
- **Hugging Face Whisper Implementation**: Added support for online speech-to-text model using Hugging Face's Whisper implementation. This provides an alternative to the local model.
- **Experimental UI Design**: A new modern UI has been designed with improved layout, better visual feedback, and enhanced usability. This UI is currently available as a separate file (improved_ui.py) but not yet integrated with the core functionality.

### Known Issues
- **Transcription Hallucinations**: While significantly reduced, model occasionally generates phrases like "Thank you" when uncertain
- **Microphone Sensitivity**: Requires calibration for optimal performance in different environments
- **User Interface**: The new dark mode UI needs to be fully integrated with the speech recognition engine

### Planned Improvements
1. **UI Integration**:
   - Integrate the new dark mode UI with the core speech recognition functionality
   - Enhance the visual audio level monitoring
   - Implement session history features
   - Add resource usage monitoring

2. **Further Accuracy Improvements**:
   - Fine-tune the anti-hallucination system
   - Implement custom domain-specific prompting
   - Add user feedback system to correct common errors

3. **Advanced Audio Processing**:
   - Continue refining noise cancellation algorithms
   - Add spectral subtraction for better noise isolation
   - Implement multi-channel audio support if available

4. **Additional UI Enhancements**:
   - Add visual feedback for transcription confidence
   - Implement themes and accessibility features
   - Add transcript editing capabilities
   - Create keyboard shortcuts for common actions

5. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Reduce latency in transcription
   - Optimize memory usage for larger models

### Next Steps
1. Complete the integration of the new dark mode UI with the existing functionality
2. Continue refining the anti-hallucination system to eliminate remaining false patterns
3. Improve the automatic calibration to work more reliably across diverse environments
4. Add customizable prompt templates for different usage contexts

### Conclusion
The application now provides improved accuracy for English transcription with significantly better audio processing. Recent enhancements focused on solving the "Thank you" hallucination issue and improving audio quality through various preprocessing techniques. While not yet production-ready, these improvements address some of the most critical limitations previously identified.
