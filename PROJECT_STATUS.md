# Speech-to-Text Project Status

## Current Status: Alpha Stage

The project is currently in an early functional state with several limitations and areas for improvement.

### What's Working
- Basic speech transcription capability
- Real-time audio processing from microphone input
- Automatic typing of transcribed text
- Support for multiple Whisper model sizes
- Basic UI with configuration options

### Recent Updates
- **Experimental UI Design**: A new modern UI has been designed with improved layout, better visual feedback, and enhanced usability. This UI is currently available as a separate file (improved_ui.py) but not yet integrated with the core functionality.

### Known Issues
- **Transcription Accuracy**: Low accuracy in speech recognition, particularly in noisy environments
- **Microphone Sensitivity**: Current microphone sensitivity settings are not optimal for all environments
- **User Interface**: The current production UI is functional but basic. The experimental UI needs to be fully integrated with the speech recognition engine

### Planned Improvements
1. **UI Integration**:
   - Integrate the new experimental UI with the core speech recognition functionality
   - Enhance the visual audio level monitoring
   - Implement session history features
   - Add resource usage monitoring

2. **Accuracy Improvements**:
   - Experiment with different Whisper model sizes and configurations
   - Add pre-processing steps to enhance audio quality before transcription
   - Implement custom language models for specific domains

3. **Audio Processing**:
   - Fine-tune microphone sensitivity parameters
   - Add noise cancellation and audio filtering
   - Implement adaptive sensitivity based on environment

4. **Additional UI Enhancements**:
   - Add visual feedback for transcription confidence
   - Implement themes and accessibility features
   - Add transcript editing capabilities
   - Create keyboard shortcuts for common actions

5. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Reduce latency in transcription
   - Optimize memory usage for larger models

### Next Steps
1. Complete the integration of the new UI with the existing functionality
2. Improve microphone sensitivity detection and auto-calibration
3. Add support for additional language models and fine-tuning options

### Conclusion
The application provides basic functionality but requires significant refinement before it can be considered production-ready. Development is ongoing with a focus on improving the user interface, accuracy, and overall user experience.

## Current Status & Next Steps (as of 2025-04-10)

*   **DONE:** Integrated the new dark mode UI (`dark_mode_ui.py`) into the main application (`whisper_typing.py`).
*   **DONE:** Added back the minimized/compact UI view with a toggle button.
*   **ISSUE:** Transcription appears to freeze or stop unexpectedly after running for a short period. This needs investigation (potential causes: audio buffering, thread interaction, resource leak?).
*   **MINOR ISSUE:** Adjust layout/spacing in minimized UI header (visualizer vs. toggle button).
*   **MINOR ISSUE:** Refine position/alignment of toggle button in main UI header.
*   **NEXT:** Investigate and fix the transcription freezing issue.
*   **NEXT:** Address minor UI layout issues when time permits.

## Development Log

*   **2025-04-10:** Attempted to adjust toggle button layout and minimized view spacing. Issues remain.
*   **2025-04-10:** Integrated dark mode UI. Successfully connects signals and basic functionality works. Added minimized view toggle. Encountered transcription freezing/stopping bug.
