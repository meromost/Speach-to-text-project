# Speech-to-Text Project Status

## Current Status: Alpha Stage

The project is currently in an early functional state with several limitations and areas for improvement.

### What's Working
- Basic speech transcription capability
- Real-time audio processing from microphone input
- Automatic typing of transcribed text
- Support for multiple Whisper model sizes
- Basic UI with configuration options

### Known Issues
- **Transcription Accuracy**: Low accuracy in speech recognition, particularly in noisy environments
- **Microphone Sensitivity**: Current microphone sensitivity settings are not optimal for all environments
- **User Interface**: UI is functional but needs significant enhancement for better user experience

### Planned Improvements
1. **Accuracy Improvements**:
   - Experiment with different Whisper model sizes and configurations
   - Add pre-processing steps to enhance audio quality before transcription
   - Implement custom language models for specific domains

2. **Audio Processing**:
   - Fine-tune microphone sensitivity parameters
   - Add noise cancellation and audio filtering
   - Implement adaptive sensitivity based on environment

3. **UI Enhancements**:
   - Redesign the interface for better usability
   - Add visual feedback for transcription confidence
   - Implement themes and accessibility features
   - Add session history and transcript editing capabilities

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Reduce latency in transcription
   - Optimize memory usage for larger models

### Conclusion
The application provides basic functionality but requires significant refinement before it can be considered production-ready. Development is ongoing with a focus on improving accuracy and user experience.
