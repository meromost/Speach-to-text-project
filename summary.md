# Speech-to-Text Project: Development Summary

## Project Overview

This speech-to-text application leverages OpenAI's Whisper models to transcribe speech in real-time and automatically type the transcribed text. The core functionality uses `faster-whisper` to process audio from a microphone input and simulate keyboard typing of the recognized text.

## Core Technologies

- **Python**: Primary programming language
- **PyQt5**: UI framework for the desktop application
- **faster-whisper**: Efficient implementation of Whisper models
- **sounddevice**: Audio input processing
- **pynput**: Keyboard control for auto-typing
- **Hugging Face**: Integration for cloud-based models (in development)
