# Speech-to-Text Project Status

## Current Status: Alpha Stage

The project is currently in an early functional state with several limitations and areas for improvement.

### What's Working
- Basic speech transcription capability
- Real-time audio processing from microphone input
- Automatic typing of transcribed text
- Support for multiple Whisper model sizes
- Basic UI with configuration options

### Recent Updates
- **Dark Mode UI**: Implemented a new dark mode UI with both maximized and minimized views. This new interface offers improved visual aesthetics but has not yet been functionally integrated with the core speech recognition engine.
- **Hugging Face Whisper Implementation**: Added support for online speech-to-text model using Hugging Face's Whisper implementation. This provides an alternative to the local model.
- **Experimental UI Design**: A new modern UI has been designed with improved layout, better visual feedback, and enhanced usability. This UI is currently available as a separate file (improved_ui.py) but not yet integrated with the core functionality.

### Known Issues
- **Transcription Accuracy**: Low accuracy in speech recognition, particularly in noisy environments
- **Microphone Sensitivity**: Current microphone sensitivity settings are not optimal for all environments
- **User Interface**: The new dark mode UI needs to be fully integrated with the speech recognition engine

### Planned Improvements
1. **UI Integration**:
   - Integrate the new dark mode UI with the core speech recognition functionality
   - Enhance the visual audio level monitoring
   - Implement session history features
   - Add resource usage monitoring

2. **Accuracy Improvements**:
   - Experiment with different Whisper model sizes and configurations
   - Add pre-processing steps to enhance audio quality before transcription
   - Implement custom language models for specific domains

3. **Audio Processing**:
   - Fine-tune microphone sensitivity parameters
   - Add noise cancellation and audio filtering
   - Implement adaptive sensitivity based on environment

4. **Additional UI Enhancements**:
   - Add visual feedback for transcription confidence
   - Implement themes and accessibility features
   - Add transcript editing capabilities
   - Create keyboard shortcuts for common actions

5. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Reduce latency in transcription
   - Optimize memory usage for larger models

### Next Steps
1. Complete the integration of the new dark mode UI with the existing functionality
2. Test and enhance the speech-to-text model recognition and accuracy
3. Improve microphone sensitivity detection and auto-calibration
4. Refine the Hugging Face Whisper implementation for better performance

### Conclusion
The application provides basic functionality but requires significant refinement before it can be considered production-ready. Development is ongoing with a focus on improving the user interface, accuracy, and overall user experience.
